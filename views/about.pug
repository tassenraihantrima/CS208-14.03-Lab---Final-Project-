                    | Downtown Donuts started as a tiny corner shop with a single display case and
                    | a simple goal: make fresh donuts and pour great coffee for our neighbors.

                    | Today we still mix and fry in small batches throughout the morning, keeping our
                    | cases full and our shop smelling like sugar and espresso.
